## Recording some basic functions in pytorch, Especially those frequently appeared in the projects.

```
torch.nonzero(): 
        (default) returns a 2-D tensor where each row is the index for a nonzero value.
torch.sort(input, dim=- 1, descending=False, stable=False, *, out=None): 
torch.clamp(input, min=None, max=None, *, out=None):
            将input进行截断;[min, max]
torch.repeat(): 
torch.expand()
```
